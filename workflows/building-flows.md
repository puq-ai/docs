# Building Flows

Create your first workflow in just a few minutes:

1. Go to **Workflows → New Workflow**.  
2. Name your flow and open the **Visual Builder**.  
3. Drag **Trigger**, **Action**, and **Logic** blocks onto the canvas.  
4. Connect nodes to define the sequence.  
5. Test your flow with **Live Testing Mode**.

💡 **Tip:** Use the **AI Copilot** feature — type what you want to automate (e.g. “When a user submits a form, send an email and log it to Airtable”) and let AI generate the flow for you.
