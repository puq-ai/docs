puq.ai is a visual automation platform designed to help teams connect APIs, AI models, and tools into powerful workflows without writing complex code. It enables businesses to automate repetitive tasks, streamline operations, and deploy AI-driven processes at scale.

With puq.ai, you can visually design flows that connect services like CRMs, ticketing tools, databases, and AI models. Each workflow can be published as an API, scheduled to run automatically, or triggered by specific events. This makes it easy to integrate automation into existing systems.

## Getting Started

Start by creating a workspace, adding connections to your favorite tools, and building flows using drag-and-drop nodes. Each node represents an action—such as sending a request, generating AI content, or transforming data—and connects to others through logical paths.
