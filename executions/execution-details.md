# Execution Details

Each execution record includes detailed information about the workflowâ€™s behavior during that run.

## Overview
In the **Execution Details** page, you can view:
- **Workflow name and version**
- **Triggered by (user, API, or schedule)**
- **Input and output data**
- **Run duration**
- **Step-by-step logs**

## Debugging
If a workflow fails:
1. Open the failed execution.
2. Review error messages in each step.
3. Use the **Re-run** button to retry with the same input.

This helps you test and fix workflow logic without recreating conditions manually.
