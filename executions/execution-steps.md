# Execution Steps

The **Execution Steps** section shows a breakdown of each nodeâ€™s behavior within the workflow.

## Step Details
For every step, puq.ai logs:
- **Step name and type**
- **Input data**
- **Output data**
- **Execution time**
- **Error details (if any)**

## Step Visualization
Steps are displayed in order, matching your workflow design.  
Failed steps are highlighted in red, and you can expand each to see logs or raw JSON data.

## Best Practices
- Use descriptive step names for easier debugging.
- Monitor step runtimes to detect performance issues.
- Re-run only failed steps during testing to save time.
