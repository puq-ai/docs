# What is an Execution?

An **Execution** in puq.ai represents a single run of a workflow.  
It contains all the data, steps, and results that occur when a workflow is triggered.

Each execution includes:
- **Execution ID** — A unique identifier for tracking.
- **Status** — Pending, Running, Success, or Failed.
- **Start & End Time** — Indicates how long the execution took.
- **Trigger Source** — Shows what started the workflow (manual, schedule, API, or event).

Executions provide visibility into how your automations perform, helping you debug and optimize flows.
