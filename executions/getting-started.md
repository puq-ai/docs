# Getting Started with Executions

Executions are the core of how puq.ai runs and manages your workflows.  
Each time a workflow is triggered—manually, via schedule, or through an API call—an execution is created.

## Before You Begin
Make sure you have:
- A published workflow.
- The necessary permissions to view or manage executions.
- An understanding of workflow inputs and outputs.

## Accessing Executions
To access executions:
1. Go to your puq.ai dashboard.
2. Select a workflow.
3. Click the **Executions** tab.

From here, you can view all past runs, monitor live executions, and inspect any failures.
