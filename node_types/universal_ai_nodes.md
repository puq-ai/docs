# Universal AI

The **Universal AI** category includes nodes that interact with modern Large Language Models (LLMs).  
These nodes allow your workflows to generate text, analyze content, create structured outputs, handle conversations, and solve reasoning tasks — all powered by the latest AI systems.

At the moment, this category includes two major providers:

- **Claude** (Anthropic)
- **OpenAI** (GPT models, Assistants API)

Universal AI provides a streamlined interface over these providers, so you can integrate AI into your workflows with minimal configuration.
