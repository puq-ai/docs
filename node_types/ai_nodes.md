# AI Nodes

AI Nodes provide intelligent capabilities that extend workflow automation with machine learning, natural language processing, speech synthesis, computer vision, vector search, and model execution. They transform static workflows into dynamic, context-aware systems that understand text, generate media, analyze sentiment, classify data, and interact with LLMs.

This page introduces the main categories of AI Nodes and explains what problems they solve, what components they include, and how they fit into automation workflows.

# What Are AI Nodes?

AI Nodes integrate advanced artificial intelligence features into workflows, allowing automated systems to:

- Analyze and extract meaning from human language  
- Generate text, images, audio, or video  
- Perform translations  
- Execute large language models  
- Interpret documents (OCR, invoices, receipts)  
- Build embeddings & vector searches  
- Classify users, tasks, or support tickets  
- Enhance prompts and automate reasoning  
- Query knowledge bases  

AI Nodes are ideal for building intelligent, adaptive workflows that respond to real-world human data.
